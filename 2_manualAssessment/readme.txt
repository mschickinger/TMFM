The contents of this folder represent the first analysis step after the position tracking. This step consists in manually checking every tracked DNA nano-object and sorting out ‘the good ones from the bad ones’.

‘dGiTSiK’ is an acronym for “die Guten ins Toepfchen, (die) schlechten ins Kroepfchen”, a line from the fairy tale “Aschenputtel” (In the English version “Cinderella”, the line goes: “the good ones into the little pot, the bad ones into your little crop”).

Also see comments in the first few lines of ‘dGiTSiK.m’ and ‘dGiTSiK2.m’.

Before being able to execute ‘dGiTSiK.m’, you first need to run the functions ‘f_pos_hist_print.m’ and ‘f_disp_from_map_print.m’ as well as the script ‘positions.m’. For ‘dGiTSiK2.m’, this is not necessary.

The script ‘jump_analyzer.m’ can be used to assess sudden jumps / jolts in the sample that lead to apparent sudden large displacements in all objects’ positions. If these artifacts occur, the output file ‘jumps.mat’ will then be needed while setting up the MLHMM evaluation (see ‘MLHMM_TMFM.m’).
