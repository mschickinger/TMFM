# TMFM
The purpose of this repository is the documentation of the Matlab code used for 
the analysis of TMFM single-molecule fluorescence microscopy data during my PhD
project in the Lab of Prof. Hendrik Dietz at the TUM (Technical University Munich).

Some of the code was developed in collaboration with other members of the group.
The contributors are acknowledged by name in the individual folders' readme files
and/or within comments in the code itself. Also, some of the code is based on
concepts that were previously published by other research groups. Please see the
readme files in the individual folders for the respective references.

TMFM stands for "Tethered Multi-Fluorophore Motion". For more information on this
method and what you can do with it, you can check out the following publication:
M. Schickinger, M. Zacharias, and H. Dietz, “Tethered multifluorophore motion
reveals equilibrium transition kinetics of single DNA double helices,”
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
vol. 115, no. 32, pp. E7512–E7521, 2018.

A more detailed account is given in my Dissertation (written in German):
Matthias Schickinger, “Untersuchung der Hybridisierungskinetik
kurzer DNA-Doppelstraenge mit der neuartigen Einzelmolekuel-Methode
Tethered Multi-Fluorophore Motion”, 2020.

I would like to emphasize that this repository can NOT serve as a ready-to-use
software package for analyzing data from arbitrary tethered-particle and/or 
tethered-fluorophore experiments. With some effort, I am certain it could be 
adapted for this or other specific purposes. However, I think that nowadays there 
are many other alternatives out there that are probably better suited for whatever
it is you would like to do.

That being said, if you want to use the code contained in this repository, or
parts of it, and you have any questions, feel free to write me an email to:
m.schickinger@tum.de

Please also let me know if you get the impression that some crucial function or
script is missing from the repository. I may have overlooked something when I put
it together and whatever is missing will probably be buried somewhere else.

For further details, please see the readme files in the individual folders.
