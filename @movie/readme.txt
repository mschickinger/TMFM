The foundation for the whole analysis process is the construction of a “movie”-object for every dataset. This folder contains the class definition file ‘movie.m’ and all method function files for the “movie”-objects.

In this context, I would like to acknowledge the major contribution of my colleague Jonas Funke. In fact, it was he who took the initiative to “go object-oriented” in the first place.
